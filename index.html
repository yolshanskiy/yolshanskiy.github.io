		<p><span class="paper-abstract">Abstract.</span> This paper investigates abnormal behavior in individual stocks using two decades of U.S. stock
			market high-frequency data. It identifies hundreds of thousands of short episodes where stocks exhibit explosive
			behavior, deviating from the unit-root null hypothesis. These phenomena span multiple days, differ from typical
			return movements, and affect a wide range of stocks, including liquid and large-cap stocks. Explosive episodes
			account for a considerable portion of stocks' idiosyncratic variance. These are transitional episodes with substantial
			partial reversal, providing predictable and tradable returns, setting them apart from large overnight
			and high-frequency jumps. I analyze stocks and their susceptibility to explosive behavior in connection with
			aggregate market fluctuations. Explosive episodes involve significant buying and selling pressure along with
			trading volume. To explain explosive price movements, the paper introduces a model involving inelastic buyers,
			insiders, and competitive sellers. It emphasizes the role of explosions in price discovery process and addresses
			the observed reversal. The frequency, severity, and reversal of explosiveness are explained by the expected size
			of inelastic demands, the knowledge possessed by a representative insider, and frequency of seeing both in the
			market. Empirical tests, using short interest dissemination dates validate the model's predictions, indicating a
			higher likelihood of explosive behavior in stocks with substantial reported short interest.</p>

		<p><span class="paper-abstract">Abstract.</span> 
		This paper shows the fragility of stable matchings in a decentralized one-to-one matching setting. 
		The classical work of Roth and Vande Vate (1990) suggests simple decentralized dynamics in which randomly-chosen 
		blocking pairs match successively. Such decentralized interactions guarantee convergence 
		to <i>a</i> stable matching. Our first theorem shows that, under mild conditions, 
		<i>any</i> unstable matching<span>&#8212;</span>including a small perturbation of a stable matching<span>&#8212;</span>can 
		culminate in <i>any</i> stable matching through these dynamics. 
		Our second theorem highlights another aspect of fragility: stabilization may take a long time. 
		Even in markets with a unique stable matching, where the dynamics always converge to the same matching, 
		decentralized interactions can require an exponentially long duration to converge. 
		A small perturbation of a stable matching may lead the market away from stability 
		and involve a sizable proportion of mismatched participants for extended periods.</p>

		<p><span class="paper-abstract">Abstract.</span> We study the effectiveness of iterated elimination of 
		strictly-dominated actions in random games. We show that 
		dominance solvability of games is vanishingly small as the 
		number of at least one player's actions grows. Furthermore, 
		conditional on dominance solvability, the number of iterations 
		required to converge to Nash equilibrium grows rapidly 
		as action sets grow. Nonetheless, when games are highly imbalanced, 
		iterated elimination simplifies the game substantially 
		by ruling out a sizable fraction of actions. Technically, 
		we illustrate the usefulness of recent combinatorial methods 
		for the analysis of general games.</p>

		We prove that for any unstable network, there exists a finite sequence of successive myopic blocking chains leading to a stable network. 
		Our proof suggests an algorithm for finding a stable network that generalizes the classical Gale and Shapley (1962)â€™s deferred acceptance algorithm.</p>
