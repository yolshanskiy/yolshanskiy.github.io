		<p><span class="paper-abstract">Abstract.</span> This paper investigates abnormal behavior in individual stocks using two decades of U.S. stock
			market high-frequency data. It identifies hundreds of thousands of short episodes where stocks exhibit explosive
			behavior, deviating from the unit-root null hypothesis. These phenomena span multiple days, differ from typical
			return movements, and affect a wide range of stocks, including liquid and large-cap stocks. Explosive episodes
			account for a considerable portion of stocks' idiosyncratic variance. These are transitional episodes with substantial
			partial reversal, providing predictable and tradable returns, setting them apart from large overnight
			and high-frequency jumps. I analyze stocks and their susceptibility to explosive behavior in connection with
			aggregate market fluctuations. Explosive episodes involve significant buying and selling pressure along with
			trading volume. To explain explosive price movements, the paper introduces a model involving inelastic buyers,
			insiders, and competitive sellers. It emphasizes the role of explosions in the price discovery process and addresses
			the observed reversal. The frequency, severity, and reversal of explosiveness are explained by the expected size
			of inelastic demands, the knowledge possessed by a representative insider, and frequency of seeing both in the
			market. Using short interest dissemination dates, empirical tests validate the model's predictions, indicating a
			higher likelihood of explosive behavior in stocks with substantial reported short interest.</p>

		<p><span class="paper-abstract">Abstract.</span> We study the stability of factor structure by analyzing its variation on different market
			events. We start by documenting variation in distributions, means, volatilities, and correlations,
			in a set of characteristics managed long-short portfolios on the weeks with large market
			moves, leading earnings announcements, and FOMC announcements with unexpected
			shocks to interest rates. This variation manifests in differences in factors extracted using
			characteristics based on statistical methods that we document using Instrumented PCA.
			The factor structure shows variation in the factor loadings and in the distribution of factors
			itself. We propose two ways of capturing event-specific variation in the factor structure.
			The first method, Treatment-IPCA, estimates orthogonal factors specific to the events we
			consider. We find significant premia associated with the treatment factors. The second
			method, Boosted- IPCA allows us to test the differential importance of firm characteristics
			in describing the cross-section of stock returns on market events relative to base periods. </p>
